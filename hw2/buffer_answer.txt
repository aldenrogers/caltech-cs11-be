The validate_user_password function only allocates 256 bytes for input
and doesn't ensure the input is within this size. Therefore we can use
a line of more than 256 bytes to overflow the buffer. In particular, a
line of 256 garbage bytes and 16 more bytes can overwrite the base and
return pointers. I provide the same base pointer 0x7fffffffe7a0 so the
function continues without crashing and write 0x400798 over the return
pointer so that when the function tries to return it instead goes into
spawn_shell. We can call cat buffer_input - | ./buffer_overflow to use
the shell.
